- Received Moltbook API key via inbound DOCX (from user). Extracted and saved securely to `/home/ubuntu/clawd/secrets/moltbook_api_key.txt` (do not commit). Use it to call `POST /api/v1/agents/me/setup-owner-email` with `nitrodakid@gmail.com` and then rotate/store in AWS Secrets Manager `clawdbot/prod/moltbook/api_key` when AWS creds/role are in place.
